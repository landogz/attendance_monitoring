Step 1: Open Laragon
Launch Laragon: Open Laragon from your desktop or start menu.

Start Services: Ensure both Apache (or Nginx, depending on your setup) and MySQL are running. You can start them by clicking Start All in Laragon.

Step 2: Open a Terminal in Laragon
Open Terminal: In Laragon, right-click on the Laragon window, and click Terminal. This will open a terminal at the C:\laragon\www directory.

Navigate to Your Project: Change the directory to your Laravel project (attendance_monitoring):

bash
cd attendance_monitoring

Step 3: Run Laravel's Built-in Server
Run the Application: To start the Laravel application, use Laravel's built-in development server. In the terminal, run:

php artisan serve

Access the Application: Once the server is running, it will provide a URL such as http://127.0.0.1:8000. Open this URL in your web browser.

Alternatively, if Laragon is set up to handle your appâ€™s domain, visit http://attendance_monitoring.test
